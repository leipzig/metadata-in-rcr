## Examples of RCR metadata standards

In this table we provide links to the authoritative publications and homepages for these metadata standards, as well as examples we have collected. `Schema` refers the parent structure this standard conforms to, if any. `Encoding` refers to the markup fornat used. Note that for schemas such as OWL, which relies on RDF subject–predicate–object triplets, the encoding could be one of at least *seven* serialization types (RDF/XML, RDF/JSON, JSON-LD, Turtle, N-Triples, N-Quads, N3), so the listed encoding is somewhat arbitrary. For other standards, such as DICOM, the encoding is a custom binary although there are numerous export format and even attempts to serialize JSON within DICOM.
